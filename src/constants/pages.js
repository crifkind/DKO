 in American Sign Language (ASL). This crowd sourced platform relies on the contribution of people proficient in\
  ASL to convert these videos to ASL. The idea is to make educational accessible to the Deaf and Hard of Hearing\
   (HoH) community that is at par with the curriculum offered to students without accessibility issues. \
   Eventually, DKO will act as a forum for expanding ASL grammar and build a network for the Deaf/HoH community. '
