export const ABOUT_DKO_DESCRIPTION = 'Deaf Kids Codes (DKC) aims to allow hard of hearing students to access the same educational \
resources as their peers. This project specifically works on STEM Education. The team came up with the idea to \
convert Khan Academy videos to American Sign Language (ASL). This way, educational content will be widely accessible \
to hard of hearing students. For ASL to be accepted as an official language for Khan Academy, at least 1000 videos \
need to be converted to ASL. This is a monumental task. Currently the Deaf Kids Outreach (DKO) teams aims to build \
a website to attract people who are proficient in ASL to convert the Khan Academy videos and upload it. With time, \
as the site gains popularity, we will reach our 1000 videos target and eventually Khan Academy with list ASL as one \
of their official languages. The project partner for DKO is Shireen Hafeez. She founded DKC with the aim of improving \
education and employment opportunities for children with special needs.'
