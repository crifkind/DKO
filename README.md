# Deaf Kids Code (DKO)

Deaf Kids Codes (DKC) aims to allow hard of hearing students to access the same educational resources as their peers. 
This project specifically works on Tech Education. The team came up with the idea to convert Khan Academy videos to 
American Sign Language (ASL). This way, educational content will be widely accessible to hard of hearing students. 
For ASL to be accepted as an official language for Khan Academy, at least 1000 videos need to be converted to ASL. 
This is a monumental task. Currently the Deaf Kids Outreach (DKO) teams aims to build a website to attract people 
who are proficient in ASL to convert the Khan Academy videos and upload it. With time, as the site gains popularity, 
we will reach our 1000 videos target and eventually Khan Academy with list ASL as one of their official languages. 
The project partner for DKO is Shireen Hafeez. She founded DKC with the aim of improving education and employment 
opportunities for children with special needs.
